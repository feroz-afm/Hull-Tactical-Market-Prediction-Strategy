Hull Tactical Market Prediction Strategy

This repository implements a tactical market prediction and trading strategy based on the Hull Moving Average (HMA). The approach is designed to reduce lag while capturing short-term and medium-term market trends, making it suitable for momentum-based and trend-following analysis.

The strategy combines Hull Moving Average signals with structured decision logic to identify potential entry and exit points in financial markets. The implementation emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and adaptability for quantitative trading research and strategy prototyping.

Key Features:
Hull Moving Average–based trend detection
Tactical market entry and exit signal generation
